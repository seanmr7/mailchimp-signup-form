This project is part of The Odin Project's HTML and CSS course. Full assignment information can be found here: https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html-and-css/lessons/html-forms

The assignment is to rebuild the form for signing up for Mailchimp.
Currently in the curriculum dynamic functionality is not required; the point is to make the form look like the real page. As much as reasonably possible.
